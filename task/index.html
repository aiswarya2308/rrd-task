                For multinational companies, the management of <b>business integrity risk</b> is a complex,
                rapidly-evolving and increasingly multifaceted exercise. New types of integrity risks recently 
                have emerged, especially in relation to <b>human rights.</b>
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                These risk can have reputational, financial and political consequences-but they are also 
                increasingly legal in nature. An emerging web of human rights regulations, mandatory disclosure 
                requirements, soft law instruments (most notably, the <b>UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
                Human Rights</b>(the <b>"UNGPs"</b>))and industry standards exposes businesses to potential 
                government sanctions, lawsuits under domestic tort and securities laws, contract claims and investor 
                pressure.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                A systemic approach to integrity risk can help prevent potential adverse human rights impacts,
                demonstrate complaince with applicable regulatory requirements, mitigate litigation risk and help 
                meet stakeholder expectations.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                The <b>Debevoise Integrity Screen</b> provides inhouse counsel, sustainability leaders and 
                complaince department with a tool aimed at navigating this increasingly complex area and its many 
                legal dimensions. The Screen includes a series of questions and practice points designed to guide 
                business enterprises in addressing the UNGP's three pillars for demonstrating "respect" for human 
                rights. Such organizations should have in place:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <img src="images/notes.svg" alt=""> 
                        <p>A <b>policy</b> commitment to meet their responsibility</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="images/view.svg" alt="">
                        <p>A <b>due diligence process</b> to identify, prevent and mitigate potential adverse
                        human rights impacts; and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="images/guide.svg" alt="">
                        <p>A <b>process to enable remediation</b> of such impacts they cause or to which they 
                        contribute</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>  
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Each company ultimately will require a bespoke, content-specific and commerically-reasonable 
                solution to mitigate the particular integrity risks that it faces. A <b>comprehensive and 
                integrated approach</b> to business risk may be the most efficient and effective option. This 
                includes possibly capitalizing on existing complaince systems, such as leveraging and 
                supplementing established anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering policies and procedures to 
                cover emerging human rights risks.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                It is likewise imperative that related policies, processes and public statements do not 
                inadvertantly <b>create litigation risk.</b> When tending to these risk areas, it is important to 
                consult appropriately with <b>in-house lawyers and external counsel,</b> including in developing 
                policies, draffing disclosure materials, conducting due diligence and desgining remediation 
                programs. In doing so, companies should make sure to take proper steps to safeguard the 
                attorney-client privilege and the related protections that properly shield certain materials from 
                external disclosure.
